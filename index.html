            <h2 class="card-title">The Art in the Hands</h2>
            <p>Art begins in real hands. Just water, flour, salt — and time. Every stretch folds in care and rhythm, letting nature guide the process. 
                With patience and touch, the dough transforms, breathing life into the loaf that waits to meet the fire.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">The Strength of the Loaf</h2>
            <p>Born in fire, our bread is a bold expression of patience and craft. Each loaf rises slowly, then meets the oven’s flame 
                — its crust crackling with stories, its steam carrying the scent of something real, hearty, and unforgettable, baked with soul.</p>
